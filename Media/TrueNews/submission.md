## Project Name
True News

## Project Summary
Instead of trying to take down fake news, we are trying to generate a crowd-sourced article list that our community will think are true, certified on-chain.
Following the [Token-Curated Registry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWWC__-Kmso9b7yCI_R7ysoGFIT9D_sfjH3axQsmB6E/edit) model, this project is about forking [HumanityDAO](https://humanitydao.org) to make a Sybil-resistant token system where participants can vote on whether a news article is accurate or not. Participants will stake our own ERC-20 token and will be incentivized to vote and curate accordingly. The people who hold the most token will *de facto* have a higher due diligence. It's a prisoner dilemna with uncertain outcome, meaning that every rational person should cooperate, hoping that the ERC-20 token could later gain value if everyone behaves for the common good.
